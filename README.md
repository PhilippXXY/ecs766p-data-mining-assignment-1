# ECS766P Data Mining - Assignment 1

This repository contains solutions to Assignment 1 for the ECS766P Data Mining course at Queen Mary University of London.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment covers fundamental data mining concepts and techniques including:

- **Task 1**: Exploratory data analysis on the Wine dataset from scikit-learn, including univariate and multivariate statistical summaries
- **Task 2**: Data binning techniques (equal-frequency binning and smoothing by bin boundaries)
- **Task 3**: Data preprocessing and cleaning, including missing value imputation and one-hot encoding
- **Task 4**: Correlation analysis between shoe size and height using Pearson correlation coefficient
- **Task 5**: Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Task 6**: Distance matrix analysis and interpretation for hierarchical clustering
- **Task 7**: OLAP cube creation and multidimensional data aggregation using the Cubes framework
- **Task 8**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification with distance calculations

## Requirements

Python 3.9.6 is required due to Cubes framework compatibility.
